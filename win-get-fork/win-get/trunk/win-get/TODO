=====================================
  TODO for release 0.1:
=====================================

Must-have:
-------------
- Put other kinds of applications on the desktop
- New architecture field: x86, x64, IA64, all

Would-be-nice:
-------------
- Disk size estimation
- More command-line options (--no-delete, --abort-on-fail)

=====================================
  Wish list for future releases:
=====================================

- Uninstall
- Upgrade
- Dependencies 
    
    These features all hinge on detecting what is currently installed, and may
    therefore be hard to implement.

- Submit function from command-line
- Integrate windows tweaks, registry edits, shortcuts
- Architecture selection (x86, IA64)
- Advanced Vista support (UAC elevation)
- Auto-update win-get itself
- Fastest mirror selection
- Automatically detect whether zip archive is zipped-installer or extract-to-install.
- Install ZIP to program files (automatically creating shortcuts, adding to path if necessary)

- Language files (requires dependencies)
